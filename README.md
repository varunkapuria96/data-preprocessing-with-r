# Tire Tread Analysis

This project, created by Fnu Geetika and Varun Kapuria for MIS 545 Section 01, involves analyzing tire tread data from the "TireTread.csv" dataset. The code performs data preprocessing, imputation, outlier detection, feature engineering, and data visualization.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following R packages installed:

- `tidyverse`
- `dummies`
- `scales`

You can install these packages using the following R commands:

```R
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("dummies", repos = NULL, type="source")
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/varunkapuria96/data-preprocessing-with-r.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd data-preprocessing-with-r.R
   ```

3. Run the R script `DataPreprcessing.R` in your R environment or RStudio.

## Description

The code performs the following tasks:

1. Loads the required libraries, including `tidyverse`, `dummies`, and `scales`.

2. Reads the dataset, "TireTread.csv," into a tibble named `tireTread1`.

3. Cleans and imputes missing data by replacing missing `UsageMonths` values with the mean.

4. Detects outliers in the `TreadDepth` feature and creates a separate tibble for outliers.

5. Normalizes the `UsageMonths` feature by taking its natural logarithm.

6. Discretizes the `TreadDepth` feature into a binary variable `NeedsReplacing` indicating whether tires need replacement.

7. Converts the data frame to a tibble and creates dummy variables for the `Position` feature.

8. Generates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between `Miles` and `TreadDepth`.

## Dataset

The dataset, "TireTread.csv," contains information about tire tread measurements, usage months, miles driven, and position.

Please ensure you have this dataset in the same directory as the R script or update the file path accordingly.
